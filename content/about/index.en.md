Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Lucas and I am {{< age date="1998-04-30" >}} years old. Here, I share my discoveries and knowledge about this fascinating field. Passionate about computer science and particularly interested in operating systems, I publish findings, practical tips, and personal reflections that I hope will inspire and help you in your own projects.
