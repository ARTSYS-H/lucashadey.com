## :books: Reading

### *Planètes* by Renaud Jesionek

As a big fan of science fiction, I recently enjoyed rediscovering the "worlds" of science fiction through captivating works. I reread "Planètes" by Renaud Jesionek, a book that took me back into the fascinating universe of SF.

### *2001 Nights* by Yukinobu Hoshino

This is undoubtedly my biggest recent discovery. **2001 Nights** by Yukinobu Hoshino is a manga series that explores deep and varied themes through short but impactful stories. Each story is a true invitation to travel, skillfully blending science fiction and philosophical reflection. These readings reminded me why I love this genre so much, with its infinite possibilities and questions about our future.

## :clapper: Movies and TV Shows

Right now, I'm enthusiastically rewatching Stargate, my favorite series. Revisiting this series is a real trip down memory lane, reminding me of captivating episodes and thrilling plots. I particularly appreciate the humor and story of SG-1, although I enjoy SGA and SGU just as much. At the same time, I recently discovered the films of [Satoshi Kon](https://letterboxd.com/director/satoshi-kon/), whose unique visual style and deep themes immediately captivated me. "Paprika" is undoubtedly the one that left the biggest impression on me, with its fascinating exploration of dreams and reality. These viewings have made me want to explore more animated films and works that push the boundaries of visual storytelling.

## :video_game: Video Games

Recently, I discovered the game [Ixion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113120/IXION/) and really enjoyed it. This management and strategy game puts you in charge of a space station, the Tiqqun, on a quest to find a new habitable planet for humanity. What I particularly liked was the well-balanced difficulty: neither too hard nor too easy, making the gameplay very enjoyable.

The story is captivating and well-integrated, with narrative choices that influence the game's progression. Managing resources, technological research, and interactions with various factions on board the station add a strategic depth that kept me engaged throughout the adventure. The graphics and sound atmosphere also contribute to the immersion in this futuristic universe.

However, the difficulty sometimes led me to lose and restart, which is increasingly rare in this type of game. This experience added a dimension of challenge that makes completing the game even more satisfying. If you're a fan of management games with a good dose of narrative, I highly recommend trying Ixion!
