## :books: Reading

### *Planètes* by Renaud Jesionek

As a big fan of science fiction, I recently enjoyed rediscovering the "worlds" of science fiction through captivating works. I reread "Planètes" by Renaud Jesionek, a book that took me back into the fascinating universe of SF.

### *2001 Nights* by Yukinobu Hoshino

This is undoubtedly my biggest recent discovery. **2001 Nights** by Yukinobu Hoshino is a manga series that explores deep and varied themes through short but impactful stories. Each story is a true invitation to travel, skillfully blending science fiction and philosophical reflection. These readings reminded me why I love this genre so much, with its infinite possibilities and questions about our future.

## :clapper: Movies and TV Shows

Right now, I'm enthusiastically rewatching Stargate, my favorite series. Revisiting this series is a real trip down memory lane, reminding me of captivating episodes and thrilling plots. I particularly appreciate the humor and story of SG-1, although I enjoy SGA and SGU just as much. At the same time, I recently discovered the films of [Satoshi Kon](https://letterboxd.com/director/satoshi-kon/), whose unique visual style and deep themes immediately captivated me. "Paprika" is undoubtedly the one that left the biggest impression on me, with its fascinating exploration of dreams and reality. These viewings have made me want to explore more animated films and works that push the boundaries of visual storytelling.

## :video_game: Video Games

My current favorite game is [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://www.sandfall.co/), and for me, it's the game of the year! Developed by a small team, it's a turn-based RPG set in a world that blends fantasy with the cultural and artistic styles of Europeans from the "Belle Époque."

The story is very captivating, the characters are very endearing, and the OST is just excellent! The way elements of French and European cultures are incorporated is well handled, and we even get a good dose of pop culture references.

As for the gameplay, I find it quite accessible but not too simple during combat phases. Being my first turn-based RPG, I wouldn't dare compare it to other big names in the genre, but one thing is for sure: the game is a great success.
